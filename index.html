		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>I'm a Front-End Web Developer who works with <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>Sass</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>PHP</strong>. I also have significant experience with <strong>WordPress</strong>. All of my sites are coded utilizing <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong></p>
		<p>I love learning and I vacuum up new knowledge. When I'm learning; I'm happy!</p>
		<p>I am a self-taught developer. While I built my first site in 1996, I did not pursue it and did not keep up with changing technology. After having to put together a site for myself 4 years ago, I realized that I wanted to get back into the swing of things. Since then, I have worked on many freelance projects and have greatly expanded my knowledge base.</p>
		<p>Before moving into Web Development full-time in 2015, for 10 years I was an Account Director for <strong><a href="//www.tmp.com" target="_blank">TMP Worldwide Advertising &amp; Communications</a></strong>, an Advertising Agency and Technology company specializing in Recruitment Communications.</p>
		<p>Additional areas of expertise include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Digital Marketing</li>
			<li>Search Engine Optimization</li>
			<li>Google Analytics</li>
			<li>Pay-Per-Click Advertising</li>
			<li>Social Media Strategy</li>
		</ul>
